The process of pattern recognition is essential to machine learning, which involves analyzing and understanding patterns and correlations among the data to extract new information. Neural networks are powerful tools for pattern recognition, capable of learning complex mathematical functions and mapping input data to output values. Neural networks use a single hidden layer to learn these functions, and the universal approximation theorem proves that these networks can learn any non-linear function. The backpropagation algorithm is used to train these neural networks, which involves feeding data through the network in a forward direction, calculating the loss, and then backpropagating the error to update the weights and biases of the network.

In this assignment, we focus on how neural networks can solve pattern recognition problems in a cancer dataset. The first part of the assignment involves creating an optimal neural network with one layer by experimenting with the number of epochs and hidden nodes. The second part builds upon the first by using the optimal network to experiment with ensemble techniques. The third part of the assignment repeats the experiments with different optimizers. Finally, the fourth part focuses on distinguishing between two equiprobable, overlapping classes in two dimensions using neural networks. Throughout the assignment, we use MATLAB to implement and analyze the neural networks, experimenting with different parameters to optimize the performance of the networks. Overall, this assignment provides a comprehensive overview of how neural networks can be used for pattern recognition and the importance of experimentation to optimize the performance of these networks.
